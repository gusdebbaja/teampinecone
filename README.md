Welcome to Fantasy# by Team Pinecone!

Fantasy# is a fantasy league themed game based on twitter mining. The player(s) choose X amount of upcoming tweets they think will be most popular.

The number of times a tweet a player sets in the game occurs on twitter, points will be allocated (1 points = 1 X tweet). The one with the most points wins each week.

Each week contains a new set of restrictions in regards to what tweet the player can use (ex: words only, numbers only, 3 words and 1 number, etc..).

Each month the points will reset completely and the previous round will be stored on the webpage for people to view.
